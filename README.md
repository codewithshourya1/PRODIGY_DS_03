# PRODIGY_DS_03 - Internship task 3 


This project is Task 3 of my Data Science Internship at *Prodigy Infotech*. The objective is to apply machine learning techniques to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on historical bank marketing data.

## Project Objective

To build a classification model using a *Decision Tree* that can predict client response (⁠ deposit ⁠: yes/no) based on features such as age, job, marital status, education, balance, and more.

## Project Workflow

1.⁠ ⁠*Load Dataset*
2.⁠ ⁠*Data Cleaning & Preprocessing*
   - Check for null values
   - Encode categorical variables using ⁠ LabelEncoder ⁠
3.⁠ ⁠*Model Building*
   - Train-test split (70-30)
   - Fit a ⁠ DecisionTreeClassifier ⁠
4.⁠ ⁠*Model Evaluation*
   - Accuracy Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report
5.⁠ ⁠*Visualization*
   - Display the structure of the decision tree using ⁠ plot_tree() ⁠
